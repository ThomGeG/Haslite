# Haslite
A small language written in Scala using Kiama as a part of a learning exercise on programming language design and development.

The majority of code contained within this project is not my own work, rather the work of lecturers at Macquarie University.
They provided the main skeleton for this project whilst students were expected to complete the syntactic and semantic analysis modules (SyntaxAnalysis.scala & SemanticAnalysis.scala), the testing suite (SyntaxAnalysisTests.scala, TypeTests.scala & ExecTests.scala) and the translator (Translator.scala) to successfully implement a programming language without concerning themselves of the tedium of low-level implementation details.
